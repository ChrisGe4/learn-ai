--------------------------
AutoTFX is an end-to-end machine learning (ML) platform that enables you to:
- Speed up ML iterations with automated modeling, training, and analysis. AutoTFX preserves your configurations and artifacts so you can easily share your work and re-execute runs at any time.
- Improve model quality by letting AutoML find the best possible model architecture and parameters for your data and quality requirements. In addition, AutoTFX integrates with the latest LLMs such as Gemini to make them readily accessible across Alphabet.
- Reduce maintenance costs by relying on an ISA certified system to handle updates, migrations, and support.

TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained machine learning models.
